# Introduction

A collection (well, one for now) of bubbles to be used with Go [bubbletea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea).

# Picker

A bubble that allows you to use the left and right arrows to scroll through a list of items. Selecting an item returns the value associated with the displayed name.
